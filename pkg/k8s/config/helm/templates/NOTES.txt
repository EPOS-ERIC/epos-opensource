Thanks to have installed {{ .Chart.Name }} {{ .Chart.Version }} as {{ .Release.Name }} ({{ .Chart.AppVersion }}).

# Get release information

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get values {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get all {{ .Release.Name }}

# To delete the release

Use helm uninstall command to delete the release.

  $ helm -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} uninstall {{ .Release.Name }}

Note that some resources may still be in use after a release is deleted. For example, PersistentVolumeClaims are not deleted by default for some storage classes or if some annotations are set.
