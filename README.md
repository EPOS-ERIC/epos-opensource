## ðŸš€ Quick Start

**Install the CLI (Linux/macOS/WSL):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EPOS-ERIC/epos-opensource/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Check installation:**

```bash
epos-opensource --version
```

**Deploy a local environment with Docker Compose:**

```bash
epos-opensource docker deploy myenv
```

**Populate it with your own data:**

```bash
epos-opensource docker populate myenv /path/to/ttl/files
```

## What is EPOS Open Source CLI?

A command-line tool to easily deploy and manage EPOS Platform environments on your computer or in the cloud, using either Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

---

## What is an "Environment"?

An "environment" is a named, isolated instance of the EPOS Platform, with its own configuration and data. You can have multiple environments for testing, development, etc.

---

## What is a "TTL file"?

A TTL file is a metadata file in [Turtle format](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), used to describe datasets for EPOS. You can find or create these files to load your own data and visualize it in the GUI.

---

## Usage Requirements

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for Docker-based setups)
- **kubectl** and access to a Kubernetes cluster (for Kubernetes-based setups)
- **Internet connection** (for downloading images and updates)

---

## Installation

### Easiest: Installation Script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epos-eu/epos-opensource/main/install.sh | bash
```

_This script works on Linux, macOS, and WSL. It will update the CLI if already installed._

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ALWAYS REVIEW SCRIPTS YOURSELF BEFORE EXECUTING THEM ON YOUR SYSTEM!

### Using Go

```shell
go install github.com/epos-eu/epos-opensource@latest
```

_Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `$PATH`._

### Pre-built Binaries

1. Download the appropriate archive from the [releases](https://github.com/epos-eu/epos-opensource/releases).
2. Make the binary executable and move it to your `$PATH`:

   ```shell
   chmod +x epos-opensource-{your version}
   mv epos-opensource-{your version} /usr/local/bin/epos-opensource
   ```

3. Verify the installation:

   ```shell
   epos-opensource --version
   ```

### Build from source

Build using `make` with Go 1.24.4 or later:

```shell
make build
```

## Commands

The CLI is organized into two main commands: `docker` and `kubernetes`. Each has its own set of subcommands for managing environments.

### Docker Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `deploy` | Create a new environment using Docker Compose. |
| `populate` | Ingest TTL files from directories or files into an environment. |
| `clean` | Clean the data of an environment. |
| `delete` | Stop and remove Docker Compose environments. |
| `export` | Export the default environment files to a directory. |
| `list` | List installed Docker environments. |
| `update` | Recreate an environment with new settings. |

**Example:**

```shell
# Deploy a new Docker environment named "my-test"
epos-opensource docker deploy my-test

# Populate it with data
epos-opensource docker populate my-test /path/to/my/data
```

### Kubernetes Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `deploy` | Create and deploy a new Kubernetes environment in a dedicated namespace. |
| `populate` | Ingest TTL files from directories or files into an environment. |
| `delete` | Removes Kubernetes environmentas and all their namespaces. |
| `export` | Export default environment files and manifests. |
| `list` | List installed Kubernetes environments. |
| `update` | Update and redeploy an existing Kubernetes environment. |

**Example:**

```shell
# Deploy a new Kubernetes environment named "my-cluster"
epos-opensource kubernetes deploy my-cluster

# Populate it with data
epos-opensource kubernetes populate my-cluster /path/to/my/data
```

### Getting Help

For more details on any command, use the `--help` flag:

```shell
epos-opensource --help
epos-opensource docker --help
epos-opensource kubernetes deploy --help
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Docker/Kubernetes not found:** Make sure Docker and/or kubectl are installed and running.
- **Environment/Directory already exists:** Use a new name, or delete the old environment first.
- **Problems with `.ttl` files:** Make sure the directory exists and contains valid `.ttl` files and that their path are valid (no spaces, weird symbols, ...).
- **Environment not found/Does not exists:** Make sure to be running the commands as the same user, the cli uses an user level sqlite database to store the environment information.

If you get stuck, run with `--help` for more info, or feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/epos-eu/epos-opensource/issues).

## Development

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment and enable the shared Git hooks.

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.24.4+**
- **Make** (GNU Make)
- **golangciâ€‘lint**

### Clone & Enter the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epos-eu/epos-opensource.git
cd epos-opensource
```

### Install the Shared Git Hooks

We include a set of preâ€‘commit hooks under `.githooks/` that will automatically run your Makefile checks before each commit:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

### Makefile Targets

Our `Makefile` provides common commands for development like:

- **`make build`**
  Compile the CLI binary.

- **`make test`**
  Run all tests.

- **`make lint`**
  Execute linters (using `golangci-lint`).

### Workflow

1. **Edit code** in your favorite editor.
2. **Run** your chosen `make` targets to verify everything passes.
3. **Commit:** the preâ€‘commit hook will automatically invoke `make lint test`.
4. **Push** your changes when you're ready.
